In one of my previous articles, I talked about how to speak English fluently by ‘thinking in English’. One of the resources for your fluent speaking is your word bank, or in other words: the vocabulary stored in your head. It is well known that storing English dictions can be assisted by both listening and reading. As listening helps you with the pronunciation and intonation, reading will help you with the spelling and memorizing the word order. Focusing on reading, one cannot simply force himself to read study books or boring texts in order to be a good learner. Remember that can also entertainment. So why with dreadfully difficult and heavy?

If you are a beginner in reading full English texts, resorting to fun and light texts is always a good call. Stop pushing yourself into reading criminal or scientific texts even though you really like reading them in your first language; because you will consult your English dictionary more than you reading the texts. A good start would be reading a story text, or better yet: a children or teenage story/ short novel. As a good learner, you need to always keep this in mind: there is nothing wrong with reading a children story even if you’re in your 30. For the, should never disregard any types of texting.
