English Text Construction is an internationally refereed journal of English Linguistics, Applied Linguistics and Literary Studies focusing on the communicating subject and the text constructing this intersubjective communication. 

The journal offers a forum for currently converging tendencies that place the text-constructing subject in centre stage

This general common denominator subsumes fundamental movements in the three disciplines of English studies, liter1ry stud1es, linguistics and applied linguistics. 

In literary studies narratological perspectives remain of abiding interest, 

as well as study of the psychologically and ideologically fragmented subject as it reveals itself in literary texts. The study of literature is currently also witnessing renewed interest in the gendered and sociopolitically situated subject and its moral responsibilities. In linguistics, the communicating subject is central to functional, cognitive and pragmatic approaches.
